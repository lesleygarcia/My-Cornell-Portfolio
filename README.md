# My Cornell Portfolio

This repository includes my machine learning project completed during the Break Through Tech AI program at Cornell Tech. The project was part of Lab 8, where we were asked to define and solve a real-world problem using the full machine learning life cycle.

## Project: Airbnb Price Prediction

For this project, I worked with the Airbnb NYC Listings dataset. The goal was to predict the price of a listing based on features like room type, neighborhood, minimum nights, and reviews. This is a regression problem because the target variable is a continuous number.

## Machine Learning Approach

I used supervised learning and built two models: a Linear Regression model and a Random Forest Regressor. I compared their performance using metrics like RMSE and R² score. I also explored the data, handled missing values, and filtered out extreme outliers to improve the model.
